Requirements to run the source:
Update macOS and Xcode to get Swift 5 

If you cannot run Sketch _ Stitch 3.xcworkspace
In Terminal:
sudo gem install cocoapods
cd /<path to SketchAndStitch3>
pod install

Next:
Open Sketch _ Stitch 3.xcworkspace

If you get this error:
“Build input file cannot be found: 
'/Users/Nur/Downloads/Sketch And Stitch Software Project/Source Code macOS/SketchAndStitch3/
SketchAndStitch3/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard’”

Solution: 
“When you upload your file to google drive without zip, it appends the extension of .
storyboard to .xml automatically and hence when you download it obviously the file won't exist. 
To solve this issue, go to the [project folder]>[Project folder]>[Base.lproj]. 
There would be a .storyboard.xml extension type of file which you would have to rename it to the .storyboard extension. 
And hence your work is done.” https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49000799/why-doesnt-xcode-recognize-main-storyboard
